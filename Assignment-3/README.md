Everything is explained in detail using comments in code and in video.

Uploaded code of all questions in one single file main.ipynb and separate files for each question named as question1.ipynb and question2.ipynb. Please check jupyter notebook files because in the jupyter only we can see two correlation graphs, in pycharm files we are able to see only one because we are plotting using matplotlib.
